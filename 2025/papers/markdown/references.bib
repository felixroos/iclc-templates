@inproceedings{glicol,
  abstract = {This paper introduces the new music live coding language Glicol (graph-oriented live coding language) and its web-based run-time environment. As the name suggests, this language is designed to represent directed acyclic graphs (DAG), using a syntax optimised for live music performances. The audio engine and the language interpreter are both developed with the Rust programming language. With the help of WebAssembly and AudioWorklet, this language can run in web browsers. It also enables co-performance with the support for collaborative editing. Taking advantages of the Rust programming language design, the run-time environment is both safe and efficient. Documentation and error handling messages can be accessed in the web browser. All in all, we see Glicol as an efficient and future-oriented language for collaborative text-based musicking.},
